/* A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;

except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;

unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.



e.g. Is the year 2000 a leap year?:

2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)



So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
